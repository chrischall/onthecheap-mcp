# On the Cheap

Reads the [On the Cheap](https://livingonthecheap.com) network — local guides to
free and cheap things to do across ~14 US cities. Everything is read-only and
needs no credentials.

## Always name the city

**Every tool except `otc_list_sites` takes a required `site` argument, and there
is no default.** Pick the key that matches the city the user means; if you're not
sure one exists, call `otc_list_sites` first. Common aliases work (`milehigh`,
`raleigh`, `rva`, `kc`, `southflorida`).

An unknown key is refused with the valid ones listed, so you'll never silently
read the wrong city — but do check that the key you picked is the city the user
actually asked about. Every result echoes back `site` and `site_name`.

Because the whole network is reachable, you can answer across cities in one go —
comparing a weekend in Denver and Portland is just two calls.

**Category and location ids are per-site.** Each site is a separate WordPress
install, so an id from `otc_list_categories` is only meaningful against that
same `site`. Reusing one across cities filters to something unrelated rather
than erroring.

The `national` site (Living On The Cheap) covers US-wide deals and has **no
local events calendar**. The event tools reject it with an explanatory error;
use `otc_search_posts` with `site: "national"` for national deals.

## Picking the right tool

- **What's on for a date** → `otc_list_events` with an ISO `date`
  (defaults to today). Each listing has its time, price and venue. Add
  `free_only: true` for no-cost listings only.
- **Scan or compare a whole month** → `otc_events_month_overview`.
- **Find articles by topic, place or text** → `otc_search_posts`
  (`query`, `category`, `location`, `after`/`before`, `view?`).
- **Read one article in full** → `otc_get_post` with an id, slug, or URL.
- **Discover filter ids** → `otc_list_categories`, `otc_list_locations`.
- **Find which cities exist** → `otc_list_sites` (the only tool with no `site`).

## Typical flow

Pass `site` on every one of these calls.

For "what's free this weekend?", call `otc_list_events` once per date with
`free_only: true` — the events calendar is per-day, so a weekend is two calls
(three over a long weekend). Give the user the title, time and venue, and offer
`otc_get_post` on anything they want details for.

For a topic ("free museum days", "kids stuff in Lake Norman"), search instead:
resolve the category or location id first if you need to filter — against the
same `site` — then `otc_search_posts`.

## Response shape (`view`)

`otc_search_posts` takes `view: "compact" | "full"`, and **`compact` is the
default** — you get the slim shape without asking. It is the only tool here
that takes one; the other seven are covered at the end of this section.

Compact projects each result down to the fields a caller ranks or browses on:
`id`, `slug`, `date` (the day, not the timestamp), `url`, `title`, `excerpt`
(plain text, capped at 280 characters), `image`, `categories`, `locations`, and
`expired`. What it drops is the rendered `content` body — roughly 20 KB of HTML
per post, on a page of up to 100 of them. Compact also narrows the WordPress
`_fields` query parameter to that same list, so the cheap rung is cheap **on
the wire** and not merely in the response; `view: "full"` is a bigger request,
not just a bigger answer.

**Two things about the rungs that will surprise you if you don't know them:**

- **`expired` exists only on compact.** Retired deals are not deleted, they are
  recategorised — so telling a dead offer from a live one means knowing the
  site's `expired` category id, and that id differs on every install in the
  network (2, 3, 4, 379, … 16289). Compact resolves it per site and hands you
  the boolean. `full` gives you `categories` as bare numeric ids and no way to
  read them without a second lookup.
- **`full` is untouched WordPress, entities and all.** Titles and excerpts come
  back HTML-encoded (`Bashes &#8212; free supplies`) and `content.rendered` is
  raw markup, because the entity decoding and the HTML-to-text pass live in the
  projection. Full costs you legibility as well as bytes; reach for it when you
  need a field compact dropped, not as a general "give me everything".

There is deliberately **no `raw` rung**: `full` already returns the upstream
records unprojected, so a third value would silently alias one that exists.

The seven tools with no `view` each have a reason, and none of them is an
oversight:

- **`otc_get_post`** — its product *is* the article body. A projection would
  delete the thing you called it for. Its size knob is `format` instead:
  readable plain text by default, `"html"` for the original markup.
- **`otc_list_events`, `otc_events_month_overview`** — the events calendar is
  not JSON. It is scraped out of server-rendered HTML into a six-field listing
  (`title`, `url`, `time`, `price`, `venue`, `is_free`), so there is no fat
  upstream payload to project away.
- **`otc_list_categories`, `otc_list_locations`** — WordPress terms, four
  fields apiece (`id`, `name`, `slug`, `count`). The ids are what you came for.
- **`otc_list_sites`** — a fixed table of the network, shipped in the server.
- **`otc_healthcheck`** — a connectivity verdict.

## Two behaviours to get right

**Month overviews are previews.** The calendar renders at most four listings
per day. In `otc_events_month_overview`, each day's `events` is a *preview*
while `total` is the day's real count — for one August that was 124 previewed
against 510 actual. Use `total` when telling the user how much is on, and call
`otc_list_events` for a date to get that day's full schedule. Never present the
preview as the complete list.

**Expired deals are hidden by default.** Retired offers are parked in an
`expired` category and excluded from searches, so results reflect things still
available. Only pass `include_expired: true` when the user is explicitly
researching past deals or history — and say so when those results are shown,
since the offers no longer stand.

## Dates

Pass dates as ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` (and months as `YYYY-MM`). The tools convert to
whatever the site expects and reject a malformed date rather than guessing.
Resolve relative dates ("this Saturday") against today before calling.
